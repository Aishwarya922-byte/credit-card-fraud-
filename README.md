# Credit Card Fraud Analysis Using Python
## Project Overview
This project performs end-to-end analysis of credit card transaction data using Python. The dataset is cleaned, processed, and explored to uncover fraud-related behavioral patterns. The workflow demonstrates a real-world data analyst pipeline that transforms raw data into actionable insights for fraud monitoring and risk awareness.

## Problem Statement

Credit card fraud is a critical financial challenge that requires systematic analysis of transaction behavior. Raw transaction datasets often hide suspicious patterns that cannot be detected without structured data cleaning and exploration. This project aims to identify fraud trends and support data-driven decision-making in fraud risk management.

## Tools & Technologies

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Seaborn

Matplotlib

Jupyter Notebook

## Work Performed

Data cleaning and preprocessing

Handling missing values and duplicates

Outlier treatment using NumPy

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Statistical visualization

Fraud pattern identification

## Key Insights

Fraud transactions show identifiable behavioral patterns

High-value transactions carry elevated risk

Fraud distribution is imbalanced

Data visualization highlights suspicious trends

Clean datasets improve analytical accuracy

Transform raw transaction data into actionable insights that help organizations improve fraud monitoring, prioritize high-risk activities, and support data-driven financial decision.


This project demonstrates how Python-based analytics can reveal hidden fraud patterns in large datasets. Structured cleaning, processing, and visualization convert raw data into decision-ready intelligence aligned with real-world analytical workflows.
